<p2 class="content"> My family consists of my father, mother, older brother, sister, and I. Throughout my life I had always looked up to my brother as like a mentor. Out of everyone, me and him are the most alike. As an individual, I've always been known to keep to myself. It isn't until you get to know me that I come off as less shy. </p2>
