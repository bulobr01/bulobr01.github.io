<p1 class="content"> I grew up in small-town Washburn Wisconsin. No one exactly knows where this town is until I mention Lake Superior. Some may feel isolated where I live but the scenery makes up for it.</p1>

<p2 class="content"> My family consists of my father, mother, older brother, sister, and I. Throughout my life I had always looked up to my brother as like a mentor. Out of everyone, me and him are the most alike. As an individual, I've always been known to keep to myself. It isn't until you get to know me that I come off as less shy. </p2>
