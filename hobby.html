<p1> All my life I've been into sports, some more than others. I was a soccer player since 5th grade and a runner since 9th. Sports are good confidence boosters as well as character builders. I will always be convinced that in order to keep your mentality sharp you should exercise. Though I've been playing soccer longer, track has seemed to be someting that I excelled at more. I have 3 records currently back in my hometown and was undefeated my senior year up until my injury. I will continue my journey here at Luther where I hope to acheive what I acheived back home.</p1>
