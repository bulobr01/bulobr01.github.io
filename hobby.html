<p1> All my life I've been into sports, some more than others. I was a soccer player since 5th grade and a runner since 9th. Sports are good confidence boosters as well as character builders. I will always be convinced that in order to keep your mentality sharp you should exercise. Though I've been playing soccer longer, track has seemed to be someting that I excelled at more. I have 3 records currently back in my hometown and was undefeated my senior year up until my injury. I will continue my journey here at Luther where I hope to acheive what I acheived back home.</p1>

<p2> In addition to the sports I play, I've always had a musical side to me. As a percussionist, I always found myself making new rhythyms on desks, tables, etc. Though I don't read music as well as I should, I always resorted to improvisation as a way of playing music. Since this is my musical skill set, I tried out for a Jazz program here at Luther. I didn't make it into the large Jazz group (not that I expected to) but I am currently in a Jazz combo. These combos mainly rely on improv so this is exciting news to me. I hope to take the talents I've gained over my life and apply/improve them here at Luther.</p2>
